### ‚úÖ About the code

```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";

export const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);
    if (conn) console.log(`Connection Successful! \nConnection host: ${conn.connection.host}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(`Connection Failed! ${error.message}`);
    process.exit(1); // Exit process with failure
  }
}
```

* `mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)` ‚Üí tries to establish the DB connection.
* `if(conn)` ‚Üí just a check that logs connection info (helpful for debugging).
* `catch` block ‚Üí handles any error if the connection fails.
* `process.exit(1)` ‚Üí tells Node.js to stop the server with exit code `1` (which means failure).

---

### ‚ùì What if you don‚Äôt write `process.exit(1)`?

If you remove it:

* Your server **will keep running** even though the DB connection failed.
* That means your Express app might start listening on a port, but **any DB-dependent routes will crash** when accessed (since `mongoose` isn‚Äôt connected).
* This can cause confusion: frontend requests will hit your server, but DB operations (like `.find()`, `.save()`) will throw runtime errors.

üëâ Using `process.exit(1)` is a safe practice for MERN apps, because it forces the developer to **fix the DB connection first** before the app continues running.

---

‚ö° In short:

* With `process.exit(1)` ‚Üí server crashes immediately on DB failure ‚Üí safer for production.
* Without it ‚Üí server stays alive but is ‚Äúbroken‚Äù for DB operations.
